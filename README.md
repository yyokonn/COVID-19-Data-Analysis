# Covid-19 Trend Analysis
In this project, I analyze a time series dataset on COVID-19 and explore the effects of vaccinations against the disease on the confirmed number of cases and deaths. I conduct the analysis on the 50 U.S. states, as well as 280 countries around the world. I create visualizations of these datasets, as below.

## Data
The datasets are retrieved from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Tools
Pandas, Plotly, Numpy
